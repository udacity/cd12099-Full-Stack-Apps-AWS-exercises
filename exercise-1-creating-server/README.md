## Important Files and Project Structure

The source code for this demo resides in the ./src directory.

### src/server.js
The main code for this demo is located in the ./src/server.js file. This includes

### src/cars.js

# Tasks
1. @TODO `./src/server.js/`
   Add an endpoint to GET a list of cars.

```
 app.get( "/cars/", ( req, res ) => {
      // destruct our query paramaters
      let { make } = req.query;

      
      let cars_list = the_cars;

      // if we have an optional query paramater, filter by it
      if (make) {
        cars_list = the_cars.filter((car) => car.make === make);
      }

      // return the resulting list along with 200 success
      res.status(200).send(cars_list);
  } );
```

2. @TODO `./src/server.js/`
   Add an endpoint to get a specific car.

```
  app.get( "/cars/:id", ( req, res ) => {
    // destruct our path params
    let { id } = req.params;

    // check to make sure the id is set
    if (!id) { 
      // respond with an error if not
      return res.status(400).send(`id is required`);
    }

    // try to find the car by id
    const car = the_cars.filter((car) => car.id == id);

    // respond not found, if we do not have this id
    if(car && car.length === 0) {
      return res.status(404).send(`car is not found`);
    }

    //return the car with a sucess status code
    res.status(200).send(car);
  } );

```
